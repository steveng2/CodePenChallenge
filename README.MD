This repo is a list of codepenChallenge that I have taken part in. 

Each week codePen releases new code challenge with a brief.  I have posted the link to my codepen submission. 

Week 1 New year, new #CodePenChallenge!

Week3  New week, new #CodePenChallenge!
You know, a little pop of color can really tie a look together! This week, we're making black & white shine with a pop of shocking pink. ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen with a black, white, and shocking pink color scheme: #000, #FFF, #FF1EAD.

It's the final week of the Color Palettes #CodePenChallenge!

This week we're going monochromatic with a palette of purples: a soft orchid, a pleasing plum, and a dusky deep purple.

ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen with this purple color palette: #E2A9E5, #632C65, #4B384C. You could choose to only use these colors, or use them as a starting point to experiment with a wider palette.
