This repo is a list of codepenChallenge that I have taken part in. 

Each week codePen releases new code challenge with a brief.  I have posted the link to my codepen submission. 

Week 1 New year, new #CodePenChallenge!
January's theme is Color Palettes. We're kicking it off with a mellow trio of peach, sea green, and sandy yellow.
ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen inspired by these colors: #A2CCB6, #FCEEB5, and #EE786E.

Week 2 January's theme is Color Palettes. This week, we're taking it back to basics with the primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen inspired by red, blue, and yellow in these shades: #F44336, #1E88E5, #FDD835.

Week3  New week, new #CodePenChallenge!
You know, a little pop of color can really tie a look together! This week, we're making black & white shine with a pop of shocking pink. ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen with a black, white, and shocking pink color scheme: #000, #FFF, #FF1EAD.

It's the final week of the Color Palettes #CodePenChallenge!

This week we're going monochromatic with a palette of purples: a soft orchid, a pleasing plum, and a dusky deep purple.

ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen with this purple color palette: #E2A9E5, #632C65, #4B384C. You could choose to only use these colors, or use them as a starting point to experiment with a wider palette.

Week 5 FEB
Shapes are one of the fundamental elements of art and design. All the arts, from architecture to painting to ceramics, are principally about the creation of shapes.

In web design, everything is a rectangle! All your block-level, and even your inline-level elements are rectangles that flow together or are explicitly places around the web browser. But of course we have tools to alter those shapes. Canvas and SVG have APIs specifically for drawing shapes. In CSS, properties like border-radius and clip-path can make quick work of slicing up shapes. I'm sure y'all can find many other ways!

Let's have some fun this month focusing on different shape-based challenges!

Week 6 
It's the second week of the Shapes challenge!

This week we're getting right to the point with triangles ðŸ”ºðŸ”»ðŸ”ºðŸ”»

ðŸ’ª Your Challenge: Create a Pen that focuses on triangles.
Show off your favorite way to make a triangle in the browser. Will you make it with CSS, SVG, or another technique?
Have you heard of the Sierpinski triangle? It's a fascinating fractal you can generate with JavaScript.
Triangles are the root of the low-poly image style. Could you create an interesting image from triangles?
